      "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Hello and welcome back to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/\">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The tech industry in China has had quite a turbulent week. The government is upending its $100 billion private education sector, wiping billions from the market cap of the industry’s most lucrative players. Meanwhile, the assault on Chinese internet giants continued. Tech stocks tumbled after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tencents-wechat-suspends-new-user-registration-in-china-to-comply-with-relevant-laws-and-regulations/\">Tencent suspended user registration</a>, sparking fears over who will be the next target of Beijing’s wrath.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Incisive observers point out that the new wave of stringent regulations against China’s internet and education firms has long been on Beijing’s agenda and there’s nothing surprising. Indeed, the central government has been unabashed about its desires to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruima/status/1420109129847214084\">boost manufacturing</a> and contain the unchecked powers of its service industry, which can include everything from internet platforms, film studios to after-school centers.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">A </span>few weeks ago I had an informative conversation with a Chinese venture capitalist who has been investing in industrial robots for over a decade, so I’m including it in this issue as it provides useful context for what’s going on in the consumer tech industry this week.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Automate the factories</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">China is putting robots into factories at an aggressive pace. Huang He, a partner at Northern Light Venture Capital, sees three forces spurring the demand for industrial robots — particularly ones that are made in China.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Over the years, Beijing has advocated for “localization” in a broad range of technology sectors, from enterprise software to production line automation. One may start to see Chinese robots that can rival those of Schneider and Panasonic a few years down the road. CRP, an NLVC-backed industrial robot maker, is already selling across Southeast Asia, Russia and East Europe.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">On top of tech localization, it’s also well acknowledged that China is facing a severe demographic crisis. The labor shortage in its manufacturing sector is further compounded by the reluctance of young people to do menial factory work. Factory robots could offer a hand.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“Youngsters these days would rather become food delivery riders than work in a factory. The work that robots replace is the low-skilled type, and those that still can’t be taken up by robots pay well and come with great benefits,” Huang observed.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Large corporations in China still lean toward imported robots due to the products’ proven stability. The problem is that imported robots are not only expensive but also selective about their users.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“Companies need to have deep technical capabilities to be able to operate these [Western] robots, but such companies are rare in China,” said Huang, adding that the overwhelming majority of Chinese enterprises are small and medium size.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With the exceptions of the automotive and semiconductor industries, which still largely rely on sophisticated, imported robots, affordable, easy-to-use Chinese robots can already meet most of the local demand for industrial automation, Huang said.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">China currently uses nearly one million six-axis robots a year but only manufactures 20% of them itself. The gap, coupled with a national plan for localization, has led to a frenzy of investments in industrial robotics startups.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The rush isn’t necessarily a good thing, said Huang. “There’s this bizarre phenomenon in China, where the most funded and valuable industrial robotic firms are generating less than 30 million yuan in annual revenue and not really heard of by real users in the industry.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“This isn’t an industry where giants can be created by burning through cash. It’s not the internet sector.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Small-and-medium-size businesses are happily welcoming robots onto factory floors. Take welding for example. An average welder costs about 150,000 yuan ($23,200) a year. A typical welding robot, which is sold for 120,000 yuan, can replace up to three workers a year and “doesn’t complain at work,” said the investor. A quality robot can work continuously for six to eight years, so the financial incentive to automate is obvious.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Advanced manufacturing is not just helping local bosses. It will eventually increase foreign enterprises’ dependence on China for its efficiency, making it hard to cut off Chinese supply chains despite efforts to avoid the geopolitical risks of manufacturing in China.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“In electronics, for example, most of the supply chains are in China, so factories outside China end up spending more on logistics to move parts around. Much of the 3C manufacturing is already highly automated, which relies heavily on electricity, but in most emerging economies, the power supply is still quite unstable, which disrupts production,” said Huang.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>War on internet titans</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The shock of antitrust regulations against Alibaba from last year is still reverberating, but another wave of scrutiny has already begun. Shortly after Didi’s blockbuster IPO in New York, the ride-hailing giant was asked to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/\">cease user registration</a> and work on protecting user information critical to national security.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">On Tuesday, Tencent stocks <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/international-investor-concerns-mount-over-chinas-tech-rout-2021-07-27/\">fell the most in a decade</a> after it halted user signups on its WeChat messenger as it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tencents-wechat-suspends-new-user-registration-in-china-to-comply-with-relevant-laws-and-regulations/\">“upgrades” its security technology to align with relevant laws and regulations</a>. The gaming and social media giant is just the latest in a growing list of companies hit by Beijing’s tightening grip on the internet sector, which had been flourishing for two decades under laissez-faire policies.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Underlying the clampdowns is Beijing’s growing unease with the service industry’s unscrutinized accumulation of wealth and power. China is unequivocally determined to advance its tech sector, but the types of tech that Beijing wants are not so much the video games that bring myopia to children and algorithms that get adults hooked to their screens. China makes it clear in its <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/April_2021_Trade_Bulletin.pdf\">five-year plan</a>, a series of social and economic initiatives, that it will go all-in on “hard tech” like semiconductors, renewable energy, agritech, biotech and industrial automation like factory robotics.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">China has also vowed to fight inequality in education and wealth. In the authorities’ eyes, expensive, for-profit after-schools dotting big cities are hindering education attainment for children from poorer areas, which eventually exacerbates the wealth gap. The new regulatory measures have restricted the</span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/\"> hours, content, profits and financing of private tutoring institutions</a><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">, tanking stocks of the industry’s top companies. Again, there have been clear indications from</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrysgao/status/1420013465805094912\"> President Xi Jinping’s writings</a><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\"> to bring off-campus tutoring “back on the educational track.” All China-focused investors and analysts are now poring over Xi’s thoughts and directives.</span></p>"

      "description": "Managers need to be able to communicate effectively, either by speaking or writing. They also need a certain degree of flexibility in their thinking and problem-solving skills.",
      "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Managers need to be able to communicate effectively, either by speaking or writing. They also need a certain degree of flexibility in their thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">One way to achieve this is by encouraging the participation of more developers in management. This way, managers can have a better sense of what needs to be done, and how it can be done.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Also, the manager must be able to think ahead and create a vision for how things will proceed. This takes deep thought and reflection.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">To do these things, the manager must be able to think independently and creatively.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Another important aspect is the ability to communicate with others. A manager must be able to effectively explain his or her ideas, so as not to create confusion.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Also, managers must be able to communicate their ideas neutrally. This means that they can't try to force their own opinions on others. Instead, the manager needs to explain how things work and what is necessary for them.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Last week, an employee of mine was arguing with me about how managers should be able to communicate effectively. To him, it seemed obvious that the manager must be a good communicator and that's why he became one in the first place. I found myself trying to explain to him that there is no reason for this idea; at least not objectively so.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Let's start with the definition of communication. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as 'The imparting or exchange of information, ideas, opinions, etc., by speech.' Or in other terms: we communicate when we share information.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Now, what happens when we share information? What goes on in our minds when we do so?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">I would say that most of the time when we are communicating with someone else, we do not actively think about what information to impart or how it should be imparted. Most of the time this is either intuitively obvious (like in a language which you speak fluently) or something that has been learned and internalized over years (i.e., something like a standard procedure for work). As such, I would suggest that communication is not really an activity but more so a reflex.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">So how does this relate to managers?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">I would argue that managers should not be good communicators.

      "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Managers need to be able to communicate effectively, either by speaking or writing. They also need a certain degree of flexibility in their thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">One way to achieve this is by encouraging the participation of more developers in management. This way, managers can have a better sense of what needs to be done, and how it can be done.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Also, the manager must be able to think ahead and create a vision for how things will proceed. This takes deep thought and reflection.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">To do these things, the manager must be able to think independently and creatively.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Another important aspect is the ability to communicate with others. A manager must be able to effectively explain his or her ideas, so as not to create confusion.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Also, managers must be able to communicate their ideas neutrally. This means that they can't try to force their own opinions on others. Instead, the manager needs to explain how things work and what is necessary for them.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Last week, an employee of mine was arguing with me about how managers should be able to communicate effectively. To him, it seemed obvious that the manager must be a good communicator and that's why he became one in the first place. I found myself trying to explain to him that there is no reason for this idea; at least not objectively so.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Let's start with the definition of communication. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as 'The imparting or exchange of information, ideas, opinions, etc., by speech.' Or in other terms: we communicate when we share information.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Now, what happens when we share information? What goes on in our minds when we do so?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">I would say that most of the time when we are communicating with someone else, we do not actively think about what information to impart or how it should be imparted. Most of the time this is either intuitively obvious (like in a language which you speak fluently) or something that has been learned and internalized over years (i.e., something like a standard procedure for work). As such, I would suggest that communication is not really an activity but more so a reflex.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">So how does this relate to managers?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">I would argue that managers should not be good communicators. Not because of some philosophical idea but because managers have no need to communicate anything.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">It is clear that the software development process should be improved by managers. No one can argue against this.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Even if the developers themselves don't know what they are doing, managers can still manage them successfully and ensure that their process is a success.

Besides, will explain some key concepts of machine learning, as generalization, overfitting, and model selection. The Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book of Christopher M. Bishop inspires the post.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Data generation</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Both training and validation sets are synthetically generated. The input variable X is generated by spaced uniformly random values in range [0, 1]. The output (or target data) variable y is generated from the generating function sin(2πx) added of random noise. The figure in the cover presents the curves of the target data (training set) and the generating function of N = 10 training examples.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Polynomial features</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">First, the input variable X (that represents one single feature) will be transformed to polynomial features (X_poly), according to the below function:<br>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">def poly_features(x, M):\n\n  N = len(x)\n\n  x_poly = np.zeros([N, M+1], dtype=np.float64)\n  for i in range(N):\n    for j in range(M+1):\n      x_poly[i, j] = np.power(x[i], j)\n\n  return x_poly\n</code></pre><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Thus, the column vector X of size N x 1 will result in a N x M + 1 matrix, where M is the order of the polynomial. For example, using M = 2 and x = 0.3077 results in three features as follows:</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R3mWVd5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgvqjcog3s584oc0p0mv.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R3mWVd5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgvqjcog3s584oc0p0mv.png\" alt=\"Polynomial features\"></u></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">The figure below presents the polynomial features of three examples of the training set.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YwBbIo_t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kgx2ink75i4ftlwwfjs1.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YwBbIo_t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kgx2ink75i4ftlwwfjs1.png\" alt=\"Polynomial features table\"></u></a></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Training</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">The next step aims to train the model (with training data), that is, find the coefficients W that multiplied by polynomial features allow us to make predictions y_pred. There are some optimization algorithms, like gradient descent, that minimize the cost function, in this case, the error between the real value y and the predicted value y_pred. Here is used the normal equation to obtain W, as given by the equation (normal) below:</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KD-QYupZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j0qpnr1hwhnt5mnzw6lp.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KD-QYupZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j0qpnr1hwhnt5mnzw6lp.png\" alt=\"Normal equation\"></u></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Where X is the polynomial features matrix of size N x M+1, y is the output variable of size N x 1, and W is the coefficients of size M+1 x 1. The coefficients obtained through normal equation are given by the function below:<br>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">def normal_equation(x, y):\n\n    # Normal equation: w = ((x'*x)^-1) *x'*y\n\n    xT = x.T\n    w = np.dot(np.dot(np.linalg.pinv(np.dot(xT, x)), xT), y)\n\n    return w\n</code></pre><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Measuring the error</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">With the coefficients W in hand, it is necessary to measure the error between the real value (output variable y) and the predicted value y_pred. It is used the Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE) obtained through the Sum-of-Squares Error (SSE) to evaluate the performance of the training model. The equations below obtain the errors:</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T5m8tpg9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iuwyrwof8rquj6szpal0.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T5m8tpg9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iuwyrwof8rquj6szpal0.png\" alt=\"SSE\"></u></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lb_4Vo-O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/imnvvneugtr5drvri4d9.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lb_4Vo-O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/imnvvneugtr5drvri4d9.png\" alt=\"RMSE\"></u></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Where N is the number of examples. The functions below calculate these errors:<br>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">def error(y, y_pred):\n\n    N = len(y)\n\n    # Sum-of-squares error\n    sse = np.sum(np.power(y_pred-y, 2))/2\n\n    # Root mean squere error\n    rmse = np.sqrt(2*sse/N)\n\n    return sse, rmse\n</code></pre><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Validation</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">The next step is to evaluate the validation set, which is data that was not in the model training. Here it is verified whether the model fits the validation set. Most steps are the same as training, how to get the polynomial features, make predictions and measure the error.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Polynomial order analysis</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">The figure below shows the four (M = 0, 1, 3, 9) different orders of the polynomial. The green curve represents the generating function, blue dots presents the target data (training data, X and y), and the red curve shows the predicted data (y_pred). The worst predictions are presented by M = 0, followed by M = 1. M = 3 and M = 9 are the ones who achieve the best prediction, that is, they are the models that best fit the training set.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nr2I0p_6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8px79xf6t7vmenvmhuyf.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nr2I0p_6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8px79xf6t7vmenvmhuyf.png\" alt=\"Polynomial order\"></u></a></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0;\">Error analysis</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Analyzing the RMSE (in the figure below), there is a tendency for the error to decrease in both training and validation between M = 0 and M = 3. But for M = 9, one notices a much bigger error in the validation set, that is, as the order of the polynomial grows it becomes more difficult for the model to predict examples outside the training set. In short, the model lacks the generalization ability. The behavior of M = 9 can be called overfitting.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q8GZbtkj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3b230mhxymog4tgc323.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q8GZbtkj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3b230mhxymog4tgc323.png\" alt=\"Error of training and validation sets 1\"></u></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">The order of polynomial helps in selection model, which the choice is M = 3, as it is the model that has the smallest validation error.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">One of the possible ways to prevent overfitting is to add more examples, in this case generating training and validation sets with N = 50, we obtain the RMSE by order of the polynomial as shown in the figure below:</p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rOEZ2oJG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/stjryytu5syphytjsgjh.png\"><u><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rOEZ2oJG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/stjryytu5syphytjsgjh.png\" alt=\"Error of training and validation sets 2\"></u></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0;\">Thus, when more examples are added, it is possible to prevent overfitting of the M = 9 model.</p><hr><p>The complete code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/rlrocha/curve-fitting\"><u>Github</u></a> and <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ava7PBC6BDYWIoUNyOUXthYzyB6yH-Dc?usp=sharing\"><u>Colab</u></a>.
